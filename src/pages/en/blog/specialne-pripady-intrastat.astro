          <h2>1. Goods Processing and Repairs</h2>
          
          <h3>What is Goods Processing?</h3>
          <p>
            Goods processing is a situation where goods are temporarily sent to another member state for processing, 
            modification, or repair and are subsequently returned to the original member state.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-primary-50 border-l-4 border-primary-600 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Example of Goods Processing:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              A Slovak company sends textile material to the Czech Republic for dyeing. After dyeing, the material is returned to Slovakia. 
              This process involves two goods movements that must be reported in Intrastat reports.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>How to Report Goods Processing?</h3>
          <p><strong>When sending goods for processing:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> 41 (dispatch of goods for processing)</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical value:</strong> Value of goods before processing</li>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Weight of goods before processing</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>When receiving processed goods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> 51 (arrival of goods after processing)</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical value:</strong> Value of goods after processing (including processing costs)</li>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Weight of goods after processing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Goods Repairs</h3>
          <p>
            Goods repairs are reported similarly to processing, but different nature of transaction codes are used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Code 42:</strong> Dispatch of goods for repair</li>
            <li><strong>Code 52:</strong> Arrival of goods after repair</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Returns and Replacements</h2>
          
          <h3>Goods Returns</h3>
          <p>
            Goods returns occur when a customer returns goods to the supplier (e.g., due to complaint, disagreement with goods, etc.).
          </p>

          <p><strong>Reporting returns:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> 21 (return of goods)</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical value:</strong> Original value of returned goods</li>
            <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Opposite to the original supply</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-slate-50 border-l-4 border-slate-400 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Example of Goods Return:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              A Slovak company sold goods to a Czech customer (reported as dispatch). The customer returned the goods due to complaint. 
              The return is reported as arrival of goods from Czech Republic with transaction code 21.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Goods Replacement</h3>
          <p>
            Goods replacement is a situation where the supplier provides replacement goods for defective or damaged goods.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Reporting replacement:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> 22 (replacement for goods)</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical value:</strong> Value of replacement goods</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Only the movement of replacement goods is reported, not the return of defective goods</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Split Consignments</h2>
          
          <h3>What are Split Consignments?</h3>
          <p>
            Split consignments are deliveries where one commercial contract is fulfilled by multiple partial deliveries over time.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">⚠️ Important Rule:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              Each partial delivery is reported separately in the month when it occurred. It is not possible to accumulate 
              all deliveries and report them at once after completing the entire order.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Reporting Split Consignments</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Each partial delivery = separate line in the report</li>
            <li>Reported in the month of physical goods movement</li>
            <li>Value and weight correspond to the specific partial delivery</li>
            <li>CN commodity code must be the same for all partial deliveries</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Software and Digital Products</h2>
          
          <h3>Physical Media with Software</h3>
          <p>
            If software is delivered on physical media (CD, DVD, USB), it is reported in Intrastat reports as tangible goods:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>CN code:</strong> According to media type (e.g., 8523 49 10 for optical discs)</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Total value including software</li>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Weight of physical media</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Electronically Delivered Software</h3>
          <p>
            Software delivered electronically (download, cloud) is <strong>not reported</strong> in Intrastat reports 
            because it is not a physical goods movement. It is a provision of service.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Distance Selling of Goods</h2>
          
          <h3>What is Distance Selling?</h3>
          <p>
            Distance selling of goods is the sale of goods to final consumers in another member state, 
            where the supplier arranges the transport of goods.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-primary-50 border-l-4 border-primary-600 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Example of Distance Selling:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              A Slovak e-shop sells goods to Czech consumers via the internet. Goods are sent from Slovakia 
              directly to Czech customers. This is a typical case of distance selling of goods.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Thresholds for Distance Selling</h3>
          <p>
            Since July 1, 2021, a single threshold applies for the entire EU:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Threshold:</strong> EUR 10,000 annually (for all member states combined)</li>
            <li><strong>Below threshold:</strong> VAT is paid in the supplier's country</li>
            <li><strong>Above threshold:</strong> VAT is paid in the customer's country</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reporting in Intrastat</h3>
          <p>
            Distance selling of goods is reported in Intrastat reports as standard dispatch of goods:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> 11 (sale)</li>
            <li><strong>Country of destination:</strong> Member state of final consumer</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Sales price of goods</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Waste and Scrap</h2>
          
          <h3>Reporting Waste</h3>
          <p>
            Waste arising from production or processing that is sent to another member state is reported in Intrastat:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>CN code:</strong> According to waste type (chapter 38 or others)</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Market value of waste (if it has any value)</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction code:</strong> According to nature of transaction (sale, free supply, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Free Supplies</h2>
          
          <h3>Samples</h3>
          <p>
            Goods samples supplied free of charge are reported in Intrastat reports:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> 12 (free supply)</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Market value of samples</li>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Actual weight of samples</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Promotional Items</h3>
          <p>
            Promotional items (promotional materials) are reported similarly to samples if they have commercial value.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Nil Declaration</h2>
          
          <h3>When to Submit a Nil Declaration?</h3>
          <p>
            A nil declaration is submitted when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have reporting obligation (exceeded the threshold)</li>
            <li>In the given month you did not carry out any goods movements</li>
            <li>You want to confirm that there were no transactions in the given month</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-slate-50 border-l-4 border-slate-400 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Tip:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              A nil declaration is not mandatory, but it is recommended to submit it to avoid reminders 
              from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>9. Data Aggregation</h2>
          
          <h3>What is Aggregation?</h3>
          <p>
            Data aggregation means merging multiple smaller transactions into one line in the report 
            if they meet certain conditions.
          </p>

          <h3>Rules for Aggregation</h3>
          <p>
            You can aggregate transactions if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is the same CN commodity code</li>
            <li>Same country of origin/destination</li>
            <li>Same nature of transaction code</li>
            <li>Same delivery terms</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Benefits of aggregation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplification of reporting</li>
            <li>Fewer lines in the report</li>
            <li>Clearer data</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common Mistakes with Special Cases</h2>
          
          <h3>1. Not Reporting Goods Returns</h3>
          <p>
            Many companies forget to report goods returns, which leads to incorrect statistics and possible penalties.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Incorrect Transaction Code</h3>
          <p>
            Using a standard transaction code instead of a special code for processing, repair, or return.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Reporting Electronic Services</h3>
          <p>
            Electronically delivered software or digital services are not reported in Intrastat, only software on physical media.
          </p>

          <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Record all movements</strong> - Even those that seem exceptional</li>
            <li><strong>Use correct codes</strong> - Each special case has its transaction code</li>
            <li><strong>Document reasons</strong> - Keep documentation for returns, replacements, or repairs</li>
            <li><strong>Consult uncertainties</strong> - When in doubt, turn to experts</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor changes</strong> - Rules may change, follow updates</li>
          </ol>
