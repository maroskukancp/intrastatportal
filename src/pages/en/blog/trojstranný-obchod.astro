          <h2>What is Triangular Trade?</h2>
          <p>
            Triangular trade is a business operation where goods physically move between three EU member states, 
            with three different entities participating in the trade. Typically, this is a situation where:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Entity A (from member state 1) sells goods to entity B (from member state 2)</li>
            <li>Entity B sells the same goods to entity C (from member state 3)</li>
            <li>The goods physically move directly from member state 1 to member state 3</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-primary-50 border-l-4 border-primary-600 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Example of Triangular Trade:</p>
            <ol class="text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>1.</strong> German manufacturer (DE) sells goods to Slovak trader (SK)</li>
              <li><strong>2.</strong> Slovak trader (SK) sells the same goods to Czech customer (CZ)</li>
              <li><strong>3.</strong> Goods physically move directly from Germany (DE) to Czech Republic (CZ)</li>
              <li><strong>4.</strong> Goods never physically enter Slovak territory</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <h2>Reporting Triangular Trade</h2>
          
          <h3>For the Intermediary Trader (SK in our example)</h3>
          <p>
            The Slovak trader has a special reporting regime:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intrastat arrival:</strong> Reports arrival of goods from Germany (even though goods didn't physically pass through SK)</li>
            <li><strong>Intrastat dispatch:</strong> Reports dispatch of goods to Czech Republic</li>
            <li><strong>VAT:</strong> Can use simplified exemption regime according to § 43 of the VAT Act</li>
            <li><strong>Nature of transaction code:</strong> Special code 21 or 29 is used</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Conditions for Applying the Simplified Regime</h3>
          <p>To apply VAT exemption in triangular trade, these conditions must be met:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Goods physically move from one member state to another</li>
            <li>Intermediary trader is identified for VAT in another member state</li>
            <li>Acquirer is a VAT payer in the member state of destination</li>
            <li>Intermediary trader uses the VAT ID of the member state of destination</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Indirect Import and Export</h2>
          
          <h3>What is Indirect Import?</h3>
          <p>
            Indirect import occurs when a Slovak company purchases goods from a supplier in another EU member state, 
            but the goods are delivered directly to the final customer in a third member state, without physically entering Slovak territory.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-slate-50 border-l-4 border-slate-400 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Example of Indirect Import:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              A Slovak company orders goods from a Polish supplier. The Polish supplier sends the goods directly 
              to a Slovak customer (end user) in Slovakia. The Slovak company acts as an intermediary.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 mt-3">
              <strong>Reporting:</strong> The Slovak company reports arrival from Poland, even though the goods didn't pass through its warehouse.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>What is Indirect Export?</h3>
          <p>
            Indirect export is the opposite situation - a Slovak company sells goods to a customer in another member state, 
            but the goods are delivered directly from a Slovak supplier to the final customer abroad.
          </p>

          <h2>VAT Exemption for Supply to Another Member State</h2>
          <p>
            When supplying goods to another member state, VAT exemption according to § 43 of the VAT Act may be applied. 
            Conditions for exemption:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Goods are dispatched or transported to another member state</li>
            <li>Supplier or acquirer arranges transport</li>
            <li>Acquirer is identified for VAT in another member state</li>
            <li>Supplier has proof of goods transport (CMR, invoice, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">⚠️ Important Notice:</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700">
              To apply VAT exemption, it is essential to have proper documentation proving the physical movement of goods 
              to another member state. Without this documentation, the exemption may be denied.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Documentation Required for Triangular Trade</h2>
          <p>For correct reporting and application of tax benefits, it is necessary to keep:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Invoices</strong> - From all participating parties</li>
            <li><strong>Transport documents</strong> - CMR, bills of lading, delivery confirmation</li>
            <li><strong>Orders</strong> - Documenting business relationships</li>
            <li><strong>VAT ID confirmation</strong> - Verification of acquirer's VAT ID validity via VIES</li>
            <li><strong>Correspondence</strong> - Emails and other communication regarding the trade</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common Mistakes in Reporting Triangular Trade</h2>
          
          <h3>1. Not Reporting Goods Movement</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Mistake:</strong> The intermediary trader thinks that if goods didn't physically pass through their warehouse, 
            they don't need to report any movements in Intrastat.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Even in triangular trade, it is necessary to report both arrival and dispatch of goods in Intrastat reports.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Incorrect Nature of Transaction Code</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Mistake:</strong> Using a standard transaction code instead of a special code for triangular trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> For triangular trade, use codes 21 (purchase) or 29 (sale).
          </p>

          <h3>3. Insufficient Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Mistake:</strong> Insufficient evidence of physical goods movement between member states.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Always keep complete transport documents and invoices from all participating parties.
          </p>

          <h2>VAT ID Verification via VIES System</h2>
          <p>
            In triangular trade, it is crucial to verify the validity of business partners' VAT IDs via the VIES 
            (VAT Information Exchange System). This verification:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confirms that the partner is registered for VAT in the relevant member state</li>
            <li>Serves as evidence when applying VAT exemption</li>
            <li>Protects you from VAT fraud</li>
            <li>Is available online on the European Commission website</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Practical Tips for Triangular Trade</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Document everything</strong> - Keep all documents for at least 10 years</li>
            <li><strong>Verify VAT IDs</strong> - Always verify VAT ID validity via VIES before the transaction</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate clearly</strong> - Ensure all parties understand their obligations</li>
            <li><strong>Track physical movement</strong> - Document the actual route of goods</li>
            <li><strong>Consult with experts</strong> - In complex cases, turn to tax advisors</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Changes in 2026</h2>
          <p>
            As part of the Intrastat system modernization, changes are being prepared that will also affect triangular trade reporting. 
            Follow updates from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and the Financial Administration.
