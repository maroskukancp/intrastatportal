            When processing Intrastat reports, we encounter recurring mistakes that can lead to problems with authorities or fines. Here's an overview of the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Incorrect commodity code</h2>
          <p>
            The most common mistake is incorrect classification of goods according to the combined nomenclature. Each product must be classified into the correct 8-digit item.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-green-800 mb-0">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> Use the official customs tariff and consult with an expert in case of doubt. An incorrect code can lead to corrective reports.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>2. Missing country of origin</h2>
          <p>
            For arrivals of goods, it is necessary to state the country of origin of the goods, not the country of dispatch. These may differ - for example, goods manufactured in China but shipped from Germany.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-green-800 mb-0">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> You can find the country of origin on the invoice, delivery note, or directly on the goods. If not stated, request it from the supplier.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>3. Incorrect value of goods</h2>
          <p>
            The value of goods is stated in EUR and should correspond to the invoiced value. Common mistakes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Including VAT in the value (should be without VAT)</li>
            <li>Incorrect conversion from another currency</li>
            <li>Omitting ancillary costs (transport, insurance)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Late submission</h2>
          <p>
            The report must be submitted <strong>by the 15th day</strong> of the following month. Late submission can lead to reminders and fines.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-amber-800 mb-0">
              <strong>Warning:</strong> The fine for not submitting a report can be up to EUR 3,320 per report!
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>5. Not monitoring the exemption threshold</h2>
          <p>
            Many companies don't realize they've exceeded the exemption threshold and are obligated to submit reports. The value is monitored cumulatively from the beginning of the year.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-green-800 mb-0">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> Set up an alert in your accounting system when reaching 80% of the exemption threshold.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>How to avoid mistakes?</h2>
          <p>
            The best way to avoid mistakes is to entrust report processing to experts. You'll save time, avoid fines, and have certainty that everything is in order.
